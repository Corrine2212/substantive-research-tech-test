# Substantive Research Tech Test

## The task:    
Gather 'interaction' data from clients that shows all the interactions (calls, meetings, etc)
between clients and financial research analysts.

My task was to pull in the data through the API and create an application that outputs this data in a web application which shows the percentages of interactions this client has for each sector.

Processing had to be done through Javascript using my favourite framework.

## Approach:

- Using figma's figjam, I started out writing out the task and breaking it down into smaller tasks to make sure I understood what I had to do. I created a simple wire frame to help me figure out the structure of the website. This also showed what components would be needed which made it easier later on when creating the folder structure.   
- I also created a kanban board to help me manage and keep track of the tasks I had set.
- Research wise, I looked at how to use Chart.js to display the data in a pie chart.

## Improvements:
- Have a filter option which allows the user to filter which sectors they want to view. 
- Look into how to access the styling options for the chart or look at other options that can be easily customised.

### Tech stack used:
- Javascript
- React
- SCSS

## How to run project: 

Install dependencies:

### `npm install chart.js react-chart-js-2 `

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

You should now be able to view in the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
